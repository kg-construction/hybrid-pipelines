You transform SKOS graph paths into short textual evidence.

Input JSON (${PATHS_JSON}) is a list of paths. Each path is a list of steps with:
[
  {"subject_label": "...", "predicate": "...", "object_label": "..."},
  ...
]

Return JSON only: a list of short phrases (one per path) that verbalize the chain, e.g.,
["A is broader than B which is related to C"].
