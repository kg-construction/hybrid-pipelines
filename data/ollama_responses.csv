prompts/ner-acm-ccs.txt,We present a simple new method where an emergent NMT system is used for simultaneously selecting training data and learning internal NMT representations . This is done in a self-supervised way without parallel data in such a way that both tasks enhance each other during training . The method is language independent introduces no additional hyper-parameters and achieves BLEU scores of 29.21 (en2fr) and 27.36 (fr2en) on newstest2014 using English and French Wikipedia data for training,llama3:8b,2026-01-04T14:39:27.2312967Z,"{
